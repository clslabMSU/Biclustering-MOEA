    """Computes the mean squared reside (MSR) of a bicluster.

    The MSR, which was defined by Cheng and Church (2000), is a
    measure of the additive similarity of the row and column vectors
    of a matrix.

    In plain NumPy code, the array of residues ``R`` for an array
    ``X`` is calculated as:
        R = X - X.mean(axis=1, keepdims=True) - X.mean(axis=0) + X.mean()``

    It measures each element's coherence with the overall mean, row
    mean, and column mean. To get the overall mean squared residue:
        msr = (R * R).mean()

    Similarly, the row and column MSRs are:
        row_msr = (R * R).mean(axis=1)
        col_msr = (R * R).mean(axis=0)

    Arguments
    -----------
    rows : 1-D array of longs
        Rows in the bicluster.

    cols : 1-D array of longs
        Columns in the bicluster.

    row_mean : 1-D array of doubles
        ``row_mean[i]`` is the mean of bicluster row ``rows[i]``.

    col_mean : 1-D array of doubles
        ``col_mean[j]`` is the mean of bicluster column
        ``columns[j]``.

    bicluster_mean : double
        Mean of the entire bicluster.

    X : 2-D array of doubles
        The data in which the bicluster is defined.

    Returns
    -------
    msr : double
        The mean squared residue of the bicluster.

    row_msr : double
        ``row_msr[i]`` is the MSR of row ``rows[i]``.

    col_msr : double
        ``col_msr[j]`` is the MSR of column ``cols[j]``.
