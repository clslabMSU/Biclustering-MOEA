    :mod:`variators` -- Solution variation methods
    ==============================================
    
    This module provides pre-defined variators for evolutionary computations.
    
    All variator functions have the following arguments:
    
    - *random* -- the random number generator object
    - *candidates* -- the candidate solutions
    - *args* -- a dictionary of keyword arguments
    
    Each variator function returns the list of modified individuals. In 
    the case of crossover variators, each pair of parents produces a pair
    of offspring. In the case of mutation variators, each candidate
    produces a single mutant.
    
    These variators may make some limited assumptions about the type of
    candidate solutions on which they operate. These assumptions are noted
    in the table below. First, all variators except for ``default_variation`` 
    assume that the candidate solutions are ``Sequence`` types. Those marked
    under "Real" assume that candidates are composed of real numbers. Those
    marked "Binary" assume that candidates are composed entirely of 0's and 1's.
    Those marked "Discrete" assume that candidates are composed of elements
    from a discrete set where the ``DiscreteBounder`` has been used. And 
    those marked "Pickle" assume that candidates can be pickled.
